              The core idea behind TheraFind is simple yet impactful: creating a
              space where individuals can easily find the right therapist based
              on their needs. In a world where mental health is often overlooked
              or inaccessible, this project aims to bridge the gap between those
              seeking support and the professionals who can provide it.

            While TheraFind remains an academic requirement for the successful
            completion of the BIM 6th Semester Summer Project, its foundation is
            built on a real-world problem making therapy available to all. This
            project explores how technology can facilitate personalized
            therapist recommendations, seamless communication, and a secure
            platform for individuals looking to improve their mental well-being.
